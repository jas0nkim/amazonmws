Unfortunately, your listing can’t be completed because you’ve reached your selling limit in this category.

All new sellers are limited on the number of items they can sell in this category per 30 days. This means you won't be able to complete this listing right now, but you may still be able to list other types of items in other categories.

You’ll be able to complete this listing:

- if one of your current listings ends without a sale in this category, or

- after 30 days have passed since you reached your limit in this category, or

- if you increase your limit by confirming your personal information through PayPal Verification.

Learn more about category limits on eBay sellers.

These limits help us make sure all new sellers meet their buyers' needs in categories where buyers have higher expectations. The number of items you can list per 30 days is limited in certain categories for at least 3 months after your first successful sale as an eBay seller. You can see the date of your first sale in your Seller Dashboard under "Your eBay Sales." If you haven’t sold an item yet the date will appear after your first sale.
